# meme-generator-telegram-bot
-
-
-
This app was created to learn how to build Telegram bots using pure Node.js.
-
-
-
Here you can launch the bot, select meme categories, (i.e. all memes are divided into categories: student memes, animal memes, military memes, life memes).
-
-
-
Then we can choose the frequency of meme generation, for example choose 10 minutes and every 10 minutes a new meme will be sent which is loaded from the MongoDB database.
-
-
-
At any time, you can turn off the generation of memes, or change the generation frequency.
-
-
-
The bot works with your own account, that is, no matter on which device it is launched from one user, the bot will work. It will also work separately from other users who use the bot at the same time
